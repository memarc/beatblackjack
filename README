BBJD - Beat the Blackjack Dealer
Main code written by Jacob Rief in 1992.
Adopted for public and published in 1998.

Purpose:
This program is not a game. If You expected a game I am sorry, You may find
something adequate for sure.
BBJD is a tool to calculate the optimum strategy playing Blackjack.
This program may be used to prove that playing Blackjack, it is possible to beat
the casino. As far as I know, Blackjack is the only game offered by casinos, where
it is mathematically proven, that it is possible to win on the long term.
It was written in 1992 during my studies of physics for a mathematical seminar
about probability calculations.
The program may be used to understand and to learn the strategies how to beat the dealer.
THE AUTHOR DOES NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY IF THE STRATEGY OR PROGRAM DOES NOT
WORK AS DESCRIBED.

Please also read the following files:
Theory: Understand how the strategy beating the dealer works.
Install: How to build the executables.
Interactive: How to use the interactive front end.
Simulation: How to use the simulating tool.
COPYING: GPL stuff.
LICENSE: Modifications to GPL.
Change-Log: Changes since first release.

Please note, that the executables have no graphical user interface (a graphically user 
interface would be too conspicuous anyway). Therefore the interface might look quite
dump. The reason is to allow maximum portability with minimum system dependency.
These programs should compile and run on practically every platform with a C-compiler,
the <stdio.h> include file and a standard C-library.
A Webbrowser may be used as graphical user interface. BBJD can also be run through
an Apache webserver.
