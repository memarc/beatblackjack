These sources contain the mathematical engine of beatblackjack.
The sources for the mathematical engine has no dependency to any library,
not even the standard C library. It should therefore compile on
every computer for which a C compiler exists. If you have any 
problems with compilation, modify the Makefile. I do not offer any
support to get beatblackjack running on your operating system.

In order to build bbjd with a very simple CLI interface, invoke 
make

If you have swig <http://www.swig.org/>, you may build the Python
interfaces invoking
make pythonmodules
