bbjd - Beat the Blackjack dealer
How to build and install:
uncompress and compile the package with
$ tar zxf bbjd-src-1.0.3.tar.gz
$ cd bbjd
$ make
this works with fine under Linux. The following
executables will to be built:
bbjd: tool to calculate probabilities and expectations interactively.
basicbbjd: the same as bbjd but for the basic strategy.
simbj: simulation of a Blackjack player using the best strategy.
basicsimbj: the same as simbj but for the basic strategy.

You may change compiler options for Your system in the Makefile.
The only requirements to build this software is an ANSI-C-compiler,
stdio.h stdlib.h and a standard libc library. This means that bbjd
should be compilable on almost every platform.

If You also want to compile the Perl modules You have to install
swig <http://www.swig.org>, a program to build wrapper code
from C for Perl, Python and TCL Modules.
After installing SWIG You can build the Perl-modules with
$ make perlmodules
These are needed to run bjtables.pl and playbj.pl.

To build everything type
$ make all

To install tyoe
$make install

If You also want to install the webbased graphical user interface
add the following lines to Your http.conf file, normally located
at /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
-------------------------------------------------------
NameVirtualHost 127.0.0.1

<VirtualHost bbjd:80>
    ServerName bbjd
    DocumentRoot "/usr/local/bbjd/htdocs"
    ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/usr/local/bbjd/cgi-bin/"
    AddType text/html .html
    AddHandler server-parsed .html
    DirectoryIndex /index.html
    <Directory /usr/local/bbjd/>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        Options +Includes
        AllowOverride None
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

to Your file /etc/hosts and restart the Apache daemon.
