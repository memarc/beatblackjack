<H4>Compare bbjd with other counting methods</H4>
We have seen that in order to win You must remember which cards have gone. This gives You the number of
cards which are still in the shoe. This isn't a simple task, specially if You have to do that in Your
head. Therefore some clever people have invented simplifications. If You reduce certain values in the
shoe You will see that some values decrease the total expectation and others will increase it. Here
is a table to show You how a decrease of one card in a shoe with two decks will modify the total
expectation.<BR>
<TABLE border=2>
<TR align=center><TD width=10%>2</TD><TD width=10%>3</TD><TD width=10%>4</TD><TD width=10%>5</TD>
<TD width=10%>6</TD><TD width=10%>7</TD><TD width=10%>8</TD><TD width=10%>9</TD><TD width=10%>X</TD>
<TD width=10%>A</TD><TR>
<TR align=center><TD>+0.18%</TD><TD>+0.22%</TD><TD>+0.28%</TD><TD>+0.38%</TD><TD>+0.24%</TD>
<TD>+0.17%</TD><TD>0.0%</TD><TD>-0.07%</TD><TD>-0.21%</TD><TD>-0.28%</TD><TR>
</TABLE>
This means that low valued cards (ie. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) help the player whereas high valued cards 
(ie. X and A) help the dealer. That's quite logic because the <I>five</I> helps the dealer bringing a
<I>stiff</I> to a final score of 17 to 21. A stiff is a score of 12 to 16 and thats risky
for busting. This means that the more high valued cards there are in the shoe, the better it is for the
player.<BR>
The "High-Low" counting method assigns +1 to the low valued cards, -1 to the high valued cards and 0 to
the rest. A player can easily add these counter-values and remember the sum. He has to divide this sum
through a certain factor depending on the number of decks during reshuffle. This way the player can
compute the total expectation upon which he shall place his stake. However the "High-Low" counting
method is a very simplistic approach. It assumes that the total expectation is a number which can be
computed by a linear equation. But computing the total expectation is a complicated task and <B>bbjd</B>
has been written to find out the total expectation exactly.<BR>
For example, take out all cards with value 10. The linear equation says that this should give a total
expectation of -6.72% but <B>bbjd</B> finds out that the total expectation is +0.05%. As You can see,
using a linear equation to compute the total expectation does not give exact results.<br>
Counting methods may be used and have been used with success to beat the dealer but they don't give
exact numbers. Be aware that in some cases You will get misleading results using counting methods.<br>
Please also note that the playing strategy varies from the basic strategy if cards of a certain 
value are gone. The effects here are not as dramatic as with the total expectation, however it is
important to adopt the basic strategy accordingly.<br>
I would like to see <B>bbjd</B> build into an embedded system which would interact with the
player through a hidden interface, possibly with small keys in the pocket or in the shoe and earphones.
I have intentionally not taken any effort to build a nice GUI around <B>bbjd</B> as this would be
useless anyway. Who could ever use his Laptop, Palm-Pilot or WindowsCE based hand-held in a casino?<BR>
I personally think that those few players who are able to count cards in their head meet the best 
requirements.

Even if this explanation demonstrates that it is possible to win on the long term playing Blackjack,
please do not believe that You can do Your earnings or even become rich with it. Lets assume that Your
minimum bet is one $ and Your maximum bet is 100 $, then playing 60 games an hour You will gain 5 $
an hour - statistically. Tips, drinks and cigarettes not included. And You still risk to loose
all Your initial capital. If You have the skills to count cards, there are many legal ways to earn
more money.<BR>
Try out <B>simbj</B> included in this package. <B>simbj</B> is a program to simulate a Blackjack
gambler using the strategy described here. Running <B>simbj</B> You will see, that You won't become rich.
Believe me, I have a casino just across the street. I could go there every night, but I never do!<P>
