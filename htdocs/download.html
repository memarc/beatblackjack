<B>bbjd</B> is a tool to calculate the optimum strategy playing Blackjack.
This program may be used to prove that playing Blackjack, it is possible to beat
the dealer. As far as I know, Blackjack is the only game offered by casinos, where
it is mathematically proven, that under certain conditions it is possible to win on
the long term. It was written in 1992 during my studies of physics for a seminar
about probability calculations.<BR>
<U>Version 1.0.1</U> has been adopted for public and released in 1998.<BR>
<U>Version 1.0.2</U>: A WWW-interface has been added in 1999. bbjd is now loadable
as Perl-module.<BR>
<U>Version 1.0.3</U>: Some bugs in the user interface have been fixed. Thanks to
Jiang Tang for reporting them. The web interface now also works with Lynx.<BR>
<H4>Disclaimer</H4>
<B>bbjd</B> may be used to understand and to learn the strategies of how to beat the
dealer. The sources are published under the GNU Public License and may be downloaded
free of charge. The program should work on every system with a C-standard library and
a C-compiler. Minor modifications to the Makefile may be necessary.<BR><BR>
<B>THE AUTHOR DOES NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY IF THE STRATEGY OR PROGRAM DOES NOT
WORK AS DESCRIBED</B>.<BR><BR>

The following executables can be build. They have a UNIX-like command line user interface.
<UL>
<LI><B>bbjd</B>: tool to calculate probabilities and expectations interactively.</LI>
<LI><B>basicbbjd</B>: the same as bbjd but for the basic strategy.</LI>
<LI><B>simbj</B>: simulation of a Blackjack player using the best strategy.</LI>
<LI><B>basicsimbj</B>: the same as simbj but for the basic strategy.</LI>
</UL>
<B>bbjd</B> now also comes with a web user interface - just like this page.
You are welcomed to mirror <A HREF="http://bbjd.tiscover.com"><B>bbjd</B></A> on Your local
machine. Everything needed to build such a web site can be downloaded from here. The web
interface is written in Perl. If You want to compile the Perl-modules for <B>bbjd</B> You
have to install <A HREF="http://www.swig.org">SWIG</A>, a program to build wrapper code
from C for Perl, Python and TCL Modules. <B>bbjd</B> also is a good example how to integrate
C-code, Perl, HTML and Java-Script.<BR>
