<H4>Basic rules</H4>
In order to understand how the best strategy is computed, lets have a look at the Blackjack
rules. Blackjack is played with 1 to 6 decks of 52 cards each. The values of the cards
correspond to their numerical value from 2-10. All face cards (Jack, Queen, King) count 
10 and the Ace either 1 or 11, as the holders desires. A score with an ace valued as 11
is named soft-hand. A soft-hand score of 17 is shown as 7/17 in this paper.<br>
The color of the cards does not have any effect.<br>
The goal of the game is to reach a score (=sum of the cards) as high as possible but
not more than 21. A Blackjack (Ace and a card whose value is 10) beats all other 
combination of cards. If the final sum is higher than the sum of the dealer, the player
gets a play-off of 1:1 of his initial stake. If the players combination is Blackjack,
the play-off is 3:2 of the initial stake. If the sum of the dealer is higher, the player
looses his bet. If the sum is equal, then nobody wins. If the player holds a score of 22
or more, he busted and thus he looses his bet immediately. If the dealer busts, the players
wins independently of his final score.<br>
Blackjack can be played from one to seven players against one dealer. The dealer shuffles
the cards. Now You and the other players must place their bets. Then each player and the
dealer receives one card. The cards all lie face up. Thereafter the player receive a second
card. The player now can continue to 'buy' further cards, one by one, until he believes that 
he is near enough to 21. If the player believes to have reached a score high enough he must
signalize the dealer to 'stay', which means not to call for any further cards.

<H4>Doubling down</H4>
The player has some more possibility's other than 'buy' and 'stay'. If he reached a score
of nine, ten or eleven with his first two cards, he can double his bet. However if he does so,
he will be dealt only one more card.

<H4>Splitting</H4>
If the first two cards are of same value, the player has the possibility to 'split hand'
which means that each of the cards are used to start with a separate bet. For each split hand,
an additional bet equal to the first is required.
There is one exception: If the player splits two Aces, he receives only one more card.
In this case a score of 21 is not considered as Blackjack.
Once the last player has decided to stay with his score, the dealer starts to draw a second
card. If his result is reaching a score of 17 or more, he will deal himself no further cards.
If the dealer has a score of 16 or less, he must draw until he has reached 17 or more. If
the dealer exceeds 21, he busts. This is the basic knowledge You have: The dealer can not split
nor double; he must play according to strict rules. And thats our advantage!<br>

<H4>How to start</H4>
The analyst sees the shoe as black box which computes him a probability for drawing a card of a
certain value. Say we have 6 decks of 52 cards, so the probability of drawing an Ace is 
<VAR>6*4/6*52 = 24/312 = 7.7%</VAR>. The probability of drawing a second Ace without reshuffle is
<VAR>23/311 = 7.4%</VAR> and so on. As the game goes on without reshuffle, the probabilities
to draw certain cards will raise or decline, depending on which cards have gone in the past.
From our point of view the shoe behaves like a wheel of fortune with varying distances
between the nails.<BR>
The first thing we have to do, is to calculate the probabilities of the <I>dealers last hand</I>. 
This computation is straight forward as the dealer has no way of doing any decision. So it
is quit easy to find out the probabilities of his final score.<BR>
The next thing we have to do is to find out the probabilities of what would be if ... . If the
players score is 16, what would be the probability of achieving 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 or busting.
Probabilities have to be calculated also for splitting and doubling.<BR>
Because the player knows the <I>dealers first hand</I> before he has to to his decision,
he can compare the probabilities of the <I>dealers last hand</I> against the probabilities
of possible final scores for each intermediate score he has. With this comparison winning
expectations can be calculated, gaining information about the best playing strategy.<BR>
Knowing the best playing strategy and knowing which final scores both, the dealer and the
player will reach, the <I>total expectation</I> can be calculated. The <I>total expectation</I> 
is the magic number playing Blackjack. If it is below zero the player has to place minimum bets
as with this card distribution he will loose on the long term. If however the total expectation
is above zero (unfortunately thats quite rare) the player has to place high bets.<BR>

<H4>Interpret the strategy tables</H4>
For each decision a player can do the best strategy can be computed. There are 20 possible
conditions where the player has to take decisions. These are:
<UL>
<LI><CITE>Buy</CITE> or <CITE>stay</CITE> if the score is 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 7/17 or 8/18.</LI>
<LI><CITE>Double</CITE> or continue as normal if the sum of the first two cards is 9, 10 or 11.</LI>
<LI><CITE>Split</CITE> or continue as normal if the first two cards have the same value.</LI>
</UL>
All these decisions depend upon the dealers first card, making a total of 200. And then there is
of course the stakes hight. The stake has to be placed before the player can see the dealers
first card. There are some default rules which should alway be followed. These fundamental decisions
are:
<UL>
<LI>Alway buy if Your score is below 12.
<LI>Always buy if Your score is below or equal to 7/17. With a soft hand You can't bust, so there is
no reason to stay if the score is 17 or less.
<LI>Never buy if Your score is 17 or higher.
<LI>Never split 5-5.
<LI>Never split X-X.
<LI>Never double a Blackjack. Don't laugh, I have even seen that.
</UL>
For other decisions consult the expectation and probability tables computed here.
