<H4>Interpret the strategy tables</H4>
For each non-fundamental decision a player can do an interactive strategy table is computed
on this site. By default a shoe with 6 decks is assumed. This is also known as the "Basic Blackjack
strategy". With changing distribution of cards in the shoe, the best strategy varies a little.
The distribution in the shoe may be changed interactively by entering the remaining number of
cards of each value or by decreasing them clicking onto the card button (A, 2, ..., 9 or X).<BR>
The percentual distribution is computed automatically and can't be set. You may also specify
the number of decks (1..6) used to compute the following tables.<BR>
A total of eight tables is computed, some show probabilities and some show expectations.
If an expectation is below zero it means <span style="color:red"><B>Don't do it!</B> and the tables
background is red</span>.
If an expectation is above zero it means <span style="color:green"><B>Do it!</B> and the tables
background is green</span>. The expectation values mean:<BR>
If you were to buy on 16 against the dealers 7, you would lose 6 additional bets in each one
hundred games.<BR>
If you were to double down on 11 against the dealers 6, you would gain 33 additional bets in
each one hundred games.<BR>
If you were to split 9-9 against the dealers Ace, you would lose 33 additional bets in each
one hundred games.<BR>
These values are computed on base of 6 full desks and will vary depending on which cards are
gone.<BR>
Probabilities are always between 0% and 100% and not colored. Probabilities are more of
theoretical interest but will help understanding the best strategy.<BR>

<A NAME="buy"><H4>Expectations for buy</H4>
This table shows the expectations when the player has to decide whether to buy or to stay.
Note that the player should always buy with a hard-hand of 11 and lower or a soft-hand of
7/17 and lower. He should never buy with a hard-hand of 17 and higher or a soft-hand of 9/19
and higher.<BR>

<A NAME="double"><H4>Expectations for doubling</H4>
This table shows the expectations when the player has to decide whether to double the stake or to
continue as usual. If he doubles he will be dealt only one more card. If he continues as usual
he should play according to the strategy described in the table <I>Expectations for buy</I>.<BR>

<HR>
<A NAME="split"><H4>Expectations for splitting</H4>
This table shows the expectations when the player has to decide whether to split or to continue
as usual. If he splits he must place another stake for the second bet. After splitting each bet
should be played according to the strategy described in the tables <I>Expectations for buy</I>
and <I>Expectations for double</I>. Please note that some casinos do not allow to double
after splitting.<BR>

<HR>
<A NAME="partner"><H4>Expectations for splitting (partner)</H4>
This table shows the expectations when two players play together. One of the disadvantages when 
You split is that You have to do another bet of the same amount. Sometimes splitting certain
combinations would increase the probability of achieving a higher final score. However as the
stake must be doubled, often is not worthwhile to split.<BR>
But other players placing bets on Your box must not double their bets after the placeholder splits.
A partner player could therefore place high stakes whereas the placeholder would place low ones on
his box. In some situations where it is advantageous to split, the partner can divide his bet.
Only the placeholder must bring in another stake according to the rules.<BR>
In these situation the expectations for splitting cards looks quite different because only a small
amount of the stake must be doubled.<BR>
This table is of rare interest as it can only be applied if two or more players attempt to beat the
dealer as a team.<BR>
<B>Show me this table </B><input type=checkbox name="espp">
<HR>
<A NAME="insure"><H4>Expectation for insurance</H4>
Another decision the player can do is to take out insurance against a Blackjack in case the dealers
first hand is an Ace. This is very rarely of interest and should normally not be considered.<BR>
<B>Show me this table </B><input type=checkbox name="einsure">
<HR>
<A NAME="total"><H4>Total expectations</H4>
The total expectation is the magic number in beating the dealer. Depending on this value the player must 
bet high or low. If the total expectation is below zero he must place minimum stakes or skip playing.
If it is above zero he should place high stakes as the theory says that in these few situations
the player has a moderate advantage over the dealer.<BR>
This table shows the expectations for each Dealers First Hand and the Total Expectation. The last
one is the number to watch.<BR>

<HR>
<A NAME="dlh"><H4>Probabilities of Dealers Last Hand</H4>
This table shows the probabilities of the dealers last hand under the condition of his
first hand. Note how high the probability is that the dealer will bust is if his first
hand is a low one. During the game we can see the dealers first hand before we have
to do our decisions. So we will buy carefully when the dealers first hand is 2-6, and we
will buy more courageous when the dealers first hand is 7-ACE.<BR>
This table is only of theoretical interest and does not influence the players strategy directly.<BR>

<A NAME="plh"><H4>Probabilities of Players Last Hand</H4>
This table shows the probabilities of the player last hand under the condition of the
dealers first hand and under the condition that the player played according to the strategy.
This table is only of theoretical interest.<BR>
